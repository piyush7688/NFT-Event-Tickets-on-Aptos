Project Title
NFT Event Tickets - Blockchain-Powered Ticketing System

Project Description
The NFT Event Tickets smart contract is a decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. This smart contract allows users to mint and transfer event tickets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures security, transparency, and authenticity in event ticketing, reducing fraud and unauthorized reselling.

Project Vision
The goal of this project is to revolutionize event ticketing by eliminating fraud and unauthorized duplication. By turning tickets into NFTs, event organizers and attendees can benefit from:

Immutable ownership records stored on the blockchain.
Secure transactions between buyers and sellers.
Elimination of counterfeit tickets through verifiable blockchain entries.
Future Scope
Ticket Resale Marketplace: Enable a secondary market where users can safely resell their NFT tickets.
Smart Ticket Validation: Implement QR-based or blockchain-based verification at event entry points.
Dynamic Pricing: Introduce a demand-based pricing mechanism for ticket sales.
Event Attendance Tracking: Use blockchain to verify event participation.
Multi-Tier Ticketing System: Support different ticket categories like VIP, Standard, and Early Bird.
Key Features
Mint NFT Tickets: Users can create unique NFT tickets associated with an event and a price.
Secure Ownership: Each ticket is tied to an ownerâ€™s blockchain address.
Transfer Tickets: Owners can transfer tickets securely to another blockchain address.
Tamper-Proof & Fraud Prevention: Blockchain storage ensures tickets cannot be duplicated or forged.
Decentralized & Transparent: Every transaction is recorded on the Aptos blockchain for transparency.
